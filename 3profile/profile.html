        <h3>Hello! My name is Elliott Bunnell, and I am a high school student at Perry Meridian High School.</h3>
        <h4>What do I do?</h4>
        <div id="activities">
            <p><b>Robotics: </b>Robotics is the one constant in my life. I've done many clubs and extracurriculars, but none of them have stuck like robotics has. In 6th grade, I was a part of the 6th grade academy's VEX IQ robotics team. That was the beginning, and the most simple type of robots. VIQRC robots are made from plastic parts and preprogrammed micro-controllers. They are great for younger kids, but for the rest of middle school I was a part of a FIRST Tech Challenge team. This is a step-up in level, with metal parts (mostly already fabricated) and a controller that must be programmed by the team. This also introduced me to some struggles such as wire management. Finally, I came to highschool. At Perry, we have a FIRST Robotics Challenge team, the highest level of high school robotics. The robots are two-and-a-half feet by two-and-a-half feet, around four feet tall, and weigh something around one-hundred-and-fourty pounds with the battery and bumpers. These robots are very powerful, and need a lot of custom programming and wiring. There are so many challenges that come with this type of robotics, like implementing PathPlanner, but it is so rewarding to see it run in matches.</p>
            <p><b>Tennis: </b>I just started playing tennis last year, but it has opened my eyes on sports. I used to play basketball and soccer, but I never really connected with them. When it comes to tennis, however, I always want to get back out on the courts. My friends will tell you that I constantly complain whenever bad weather strikes, because I probably intended to go out and play tennis that day. Having a physical acitivity that doubles as a social environment definitely helps with both my mental and physical health.</p>
            <p><b>StuVo: </b>At Perry, we don't exactly have a "student council." Instead, we have what we call Student Voice, or StuVo. It is a club full of people that love class competitions and our school, and want to see more people excited about the events that Perry hosts. While I just joined as a representative this year, I was involved with many things that StuVo does last year, and I knew that I wanted to be a more integral part of the whole process. Plus, it's a great group of people that I want to be around more, as they can teach me more about being a leader and a enthuastic person in general.</p>
            <p><b>German National Honors Society: </b>German National Honors Society (GNHS) is a club for students in German class that want to be a bigger part of the German culture at our school. It is a small club, but we do a lot of fun activities, like taking a trip to the Christkindlmarkt in Carmel.</p>
            <p><b>Link Crew Leader: </b>Link Crew Leaders help incoming freshman become adjusted to the highschool environment. Only upperclassmen can become Leaders, so this will be my first year. I am excited to be a good rolemodel for the new students coming to our school, and I want them to have the best year possible.</p>
